# **Task Scheduler**  

## **Introduction**  
The **Task Scheduler** is a web-based application that allows users to **add, prioritize, and manage tasks** efficiently. Users can enter a task, set its **priority level (High, Medium, Low)**, and specify a **deadline**. The application also provides options to **mark tasks as completed** or **delete them** when they are no longer needed. This project is developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to offer a dynamic and user-friendly task management experience.

## **Objectives**  
✔️ Allow users to **input tasks** with deadlines.  
✔️ Provide **priority selection** for better task management.  
✔️ Ensure users **select valid dates** (no past dates allowed).  
✔️ Enable users to **mark tasks as completed** or **remove them** when done.  
✔️ Offer a **responsive and visually appealing interface**.

## **Technologies Used**  
- **HTML**: Structures the task scheduler, including input fields and buttons.  
- **CSS**: Enhances the visual appearance and improves user experience.  
- **JavaScript**: Implements task addition, validation, and interaction functionalities.

## **How It Works (Step by Step)**  

### **1️⃣ User Adds a Task**  
- The user enters a task description.  
- The user selects a **priority level** (High, Medium, Low).  
- The user chooses a **deadline date**.  

### **2️⃣ Input Validation**  
- The system ensures **all fields are filled** before adding the task.  
- It **prevents selecting past dates** to ensure valid scheduling.  
- If an invalid input is detected, an **alert message** appears.  

### **3️⃣ Task Display & Management**  
- Once added, the task appears in the task list with its **priority and deadline**.  
- Each task has two buttons:  
  - **Mark Done** – Changes the status of the task.  
  - **Delete** – Removes the task from the list.  

### **4️⃣ Marking a Task as Done or Undoing It**  
- Clicking the **"Mark Done"** button changes it to **"Undo"** and vice versa.  
- This allows users to track completed and pending tasks.  

### **5️⃣ Deleting a Task**  
- Clicking the **"Delete"** button removes the task from the list.
